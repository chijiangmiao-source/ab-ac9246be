# lock-audit — restricted-view locked-vote trajectory audit service

Before the redundant controller switches its master node, this service
re-audits a captured voting trajectory and confirms that no validator voted
for a conflicting branch without a higher-certificate unlock — the condition
under which two chains could be finalized at once. The service is pure
Python 3.11 standard library (including a dependency-free RFC 8032 Ed25519
implementation), so the image builds with no network access.

## Model

* **Validators** — 4 or 7 distinct Ed25519 public keys (32 bytes, lowercase
  hex). With `n` validators, `f = (n-1)//3` and the threshold is
  `2f+1` (3 of 4, or 5 of 7).
* **Genesis** — the caller-supplied genesis block (`view 0`). Its certificate
  is implicit: every validator starts locked on genesis, and proposals may
  justify against it.
* **Events** — at most 64, replayed strictly in capture order:
  * `proposal` — a block extending a certificate. The referenced certificate
    must already be formed (2f+1 distinct valid votes, or genesis), the
    parent block must equal the certified block, the proposal view must
    exceed the certificate view, and `block_id` must equal the canonical
    block hash.
  * `vote` — a validator's Ed25519 signature over the canonical UTF-8 vote
    fields (see below). A certificate forms the moment 2f+1 *distinct*
    validators voted for the same `(block, view)`; later distinct signers
    still join the certificate.
  * `qc_observation` — records that a validator has observed a formed
    certificate. A validator's **locked block** is the block of the
    highest-view certificate it has observed; locks only move to strictly
    higher views.

### Locking rules (checked per vote)

A validator may vote for a candidate only if

1. the candidate **extends its locked block**, or
2. the candidate's justifying certificate has a **strictly higher view**
   than the validator's locked certificate (the higher-proof unlock);

and it may vote **at most once per view**. The first missing certificate,
invalid signature, duplicate identity, dangling parent, or unsafe vote
**freezes the audit at that event**: the verdict is `rejected`, the
violating event index and reason are reported, and no conclusions are drawn
from later events. Duplicate validator public keys in the submission itself
are rejected up front with HTTP 400 (`duplicate_identity`).

### Commit rule

When certificates (each actually reaching 2f+1 distinct signers) exist for a
chain of **three blocks in three consecutive views** — `B1@v ← B2@v+1 ←
B3@v+2` — the head `B1` and its uncommitted ancestors are committed. The
verdict reports the committed blocks in order, the deciding certificate and
its signers for each commit, every formed certificate with its signers, and
every validator's lock changes.

## Canonical formats

Vote signatures cover the UTF-8 encoding of

```
lock-audit.v1
vote
audit:{audit_id}
view:{view}
block:{block_id}
```

and `block_id` is `sha256` of the UTF-8 encoding of

```
lock-audit.v1
block
view:{view}
parent:{parent_id}
qc_view:{qc.view}
qc_block:{qc.block_id}
proposer:{proposer_pubkey_hex}
payload:{payload as JSON string}
```

## HTTP API

Port is configurable via `PORT` (default 8080). All bodies are JSON.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness: `200 {"status":"ok"}` |
| `POST` | `/v1/audits` | Submit a trajectory for audit |
| `GET` | `/v1/audits/{audit_id}` | Fetch the stored verdict (`404` if none) |

`POST /v1/audits` responses:

* `201` — new verdict (`"replayed": false`), status `accepted` or `rejected`;
* `200` — the same `audit_id` was resubmitted with semantically identical
  content: the original verdict is replayed (`"replayed": true`);
* `409` — the same `audit_id` with different content: explicit conflict;
* `400` — structurally invalid submission (wrong key count,
  `duplicate_identity`, more than 64 events, malformed fields, ...).

### Submission

```json
{
  "audit_id": "capture-2026-10-05-a",
  "validators": ["<64 hex chars>", "... 4 or 7 keys ..."],
  "genesis": {"id": "<64 hex chars>", "view": 0},
  "events": [
    {"type": "proposal", "proposer": "<hex>", "view": 1,
     "block_id": "<hex>", "parent_id": "<hex>",
     "qc": {"block_id": "<hex>", "view": 0}, "payload": "optional"},
    {"type": "vote", "validator": "<hex>", "view": 1,
     "block_id": "<hex>", "signature": "<128 hex chars>"},
    {"type": "qc_observation", "validator": "<hex>",
     "block_id": "<hex>", "view": 1}
  ]
}
```

### Verdict

```json
{
  "audit_id": "capture-2026-10-05-a",
  "status": "accepted | rejected",
  "validator_count": 4, "f": 1, "quorum": 3,
  "events_total": 30, "events_processed": 30,
  "violation": null | {"event_index": 7, "type": "unsafe_vote", "detail": "..."},
  "committed": ["<block_id>", "..."],
  "commits": [{"blocks": ["..."], "decide_qc": {"block_id": "...", "view": 3,
               "signers": ["..."]}}],
  "certificates": [{"block_id": "...", "view": 1, "signers": ["..."],
                    "formed_at": 3}],
  "locks": {"<validator>": {"locked": {"block_id": "...", "view": 4},
            "history": [{"event_index": 5, "block_id": "...", "view": 1}]}}
}
```

Violation types: `missing_certificate`, `invalid_signature`,
`unknown_validator`, `dangling_parent`, `parent_qc_mismatch`,
`invalid_block_hash`, `invalid_view`, `double_vote`, `unknown_block`,
`view_mismatch`, `unsafe_vote`.

## Run

```sh
docker compose up --build audit          # serves on ${HOST_PORT:-8080}
# or locally, no container:
PORT=8080 python -m app.server
```

Verdicts are kept in memory; set `AUDIT_STORE_FILE=/path/audits.json` to
persist them across restarts.

## Verify

`verify.sh` (or `docker compose up --build --exit-code-from verify verify`)
performs the whole review in one run and exits with the result status:

1. builds the image (`--build`);
2. runs the lock-rule unit tests (Ed25519 vectors, consensus rules, API);
3. waits for the healthy `audit` container and runs HTTP smoke checks:
   commit trajectories for 4 and 7 validators, reject trajectories (unsafe
   vote, invalid signature, missing certificate), idempotent replay, and
   conflict handling.

Exit code `0` means everything passed; any failure exits `1`.

```sh
./verify.sh
```
